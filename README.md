# Temporal Vault: Decentralized Autonomous Time Capsule Platform

## Overview

Temporal Vault is a groundbreaking blockchain-powered platform that revolutionizes how we preserve, store, and deliver messages across time. By leveraging decentralized technologies, smart contracts, and innovative tokenization mechanisms, we create a secure, immutable system for transmitting digital time capsules.

## Key Features

### 🕰️ Smart Time-Locking Mechanisms
- Precise scheduling of future message deliveries
- Cryptographically secured time-release protocols
- Flexible time-locking options from months to centuries

### 🔐 Decentralized Storage and Integrity
- Distributed network of "Future Nodes" ensuring message preservation
- Redundant storage across multiple blockchain nodes
- Cryptographic proofs of data integrity and non-tampering

### 💎 Tokenized Maintenance Model
- Native utility token for long-term data storage maintenance
- Economic incentives for node operators
- Staking mechanisms to ensure network reliability

### 👥 Advanced Beneficiary Systems
- Multiple inheritance and access control layers
- Granular permissions for message access
- Dead man's switch and multi-signature recovery options

### 🌐 Immersive Experience Layers
- AR/VR integration for interactive time capsule exploration
- Multimedia support for rich, context-aware message delivery
- Verifiable provenance and authenticity tracking

## Smart Contract Testing

Use Clarinet for comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Run contract unit tests
clarinet test

# Test time-locking mechanisms
clarinet test --focus time-lock

# Verify beneficiary access protocols
clarinet test --focus beneficiary-access
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
